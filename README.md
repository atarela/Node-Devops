    3.Configuration with CI server
    4.Provide a README file

```

## Running instruction
```
   `npm start` or `npm run dev`
    For testing `npm test`
```

 ## Difficulties
 
        ``` DevOps ```
    We found Some difficulties using Jenkins for The CI serve, as our CI server was in localhost and Github accept only public addresses. And also when we changed The Jenkins URL from http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/ to http://176.138.171.79:8080/github-webhook/ it didn't work well :(
